				<i class="fas fa-briefcase"></i>
				<span>Aug 2024 -- Dec 2024</span>
				<h3>Software Engineer Co-op at Boehringer Ingelheim</h3>
				<p>I designed an LLM agent using LangChain, GPT-4, and Map-Reduce workflows for survey theme extraction,
					employing semantic chunking and summarization techniques to drastically streamline analysis. I also created
					a
					robust FastAPI microservice in Python, integrating custom-trained YOLOv11 and EasyOCR models on Databricks
					to
					automate distribution and packaging workflows. Additionally, I developed a full-stack batch record
					management
					system using Next.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL, incorporating real-time Kanban tracking, Power BI
					dashboards, and auto-scaling features to efficiently manage records. Furthermore, I engineered ETL pipelines
					with PySpark, Databricks, and SQL for big data processing in TrackWise Oracle DB, enabling the delivery of
					dynamic Power BI dashboards for daily tracking.</p>

				<h3>Machine Learning Researcher at UMass BioNLP Lab</h3>
				<p>I spearheaded the design and evaluation of robust NLP models for out-of-distribution sentiment analysis
					across multiple datasets by implementing innovative techniques such as K-shot learning, chain-of-thought
					prompting, and in-context learning. I also curated benchmarks in medical NLP using Gaussian Mixture Models
					and
					UMAP to identify distribution shifts. Additionally, I constructed end-to-end LLM pipelines using
					state-of-the-art models like BERT, Llama, and the GPT family, processing large-scale training samples and
					optimizing GPU memory usage through advanced quantization techniques, resulting in strong in-distribution
					performance.</p>
